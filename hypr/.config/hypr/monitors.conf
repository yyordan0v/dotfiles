# Change to 1 if on a 1x display (then change last "auto" to 1 in monitor=)
# Change to something like 1.75 for fractional scaling (can work well with 1.66667 monitor scaling)
env = GDK_SCALE,1.25

# Use single default monitor (see all monitors with: hyprctl monitors)
# Format: monitor = [port], resolution, position, scale
